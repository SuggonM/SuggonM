My programming journey began in 2024 with javascript, back when I was just a freshman contributor and maintainer of [GT Wikia](https://guardian-tales.fandom.com/wiki/User:Suggon). The inspiration came from someone named seiya — *if you're reading this, thank you!*

Dynamically typed languages are "my type" (except PHP… not really proud of that one)

In free time, I like listening to tech talks and podcasts on youtube

As of today, I've jumped ship from <img src="https://github.com/microsoft.png" alt="" height="18" valign="middle"> wind*ws to <img src="https://github.com/ubuntu.png" alt="" height="18" valign="middle"> [Ubuntu](https://github.com/ubuntu) (Linux). Although, I'd still be thanking microsoft's [WSL terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL) (which uses <img src="https://github.com/ubuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu" height="18" valign="middle">) for making the jump easier
